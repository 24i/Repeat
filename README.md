## WHAT'S REPEAT



## Installation

<a name="cocoapods" />

### Install via CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Objective-C, which automates and simplifies the process of using 3rd-party libraries like Repeat in your projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

> CocoaPods 1.0.1+ is required to build Repeat.

#### Install via Podfile

To integrate Repeat into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '8.0'

target 'TargetName' do
use_frameworks!
pod 'Repeast'
end
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

<a name="carthage" />

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate Repeat into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "malcommac/Repeat"
```

Run `carthage` to build the framework and drag the built `Repeat.framework` into your Xcode project.
